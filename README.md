# Lab

In this lab, you will have a chance to reflect on bottom-up and top-down program comprehension styles. The code snippets you see and implement will be good practice for interview questions that you will have when going on the job circuit.

To receive credit for participation in today's lab, turn in the "answers.xml" file that is generated at the end of the exercise. To locate the file, look in NoExperimentCode_ID/answers.xml, where ID is the name you entered at the start.

### Program Comprehension Exercise

1) Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/CSC-326/ProgramComprehensionLab.git
```

2) Run viewer.jar:

```
java -jar Viewer.jar
```

3) Load the PrePilot.xml

4) Follow the instructions. You will be shown a code snippet, asked to re-implement it from memory, and shown the code snippet again. Later on you will be asked to correctly identify a code snippet that will obfuscated, which will test your ability to use pattern matching for identifying the code. 

5) Submit your "answers.xml" [here](http://checkbox.io/studies/?id=56fc6f322b7574501f00000b).
